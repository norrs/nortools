# Desktop UI Screenshots

This folder stores Linux desktop UI screenshots captured from release artifacts.

## Naming

- `01-home.png`
- `02-dns-lookup.png`
- `03-http-check.png`
- `04-https-ssl.png`
- `05-subnet-calculator.png`
- `06-password-generator.png`
- `07-about.png`

## Generation

Screenshots are generated by:

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release-desktop-screenshots.yml`
- Script: `scripts/release/capture_desktop_screenshots.py`

The pipeline launches the native Linux release artifact inside `Xvfb`, waits for AT-SPI visibility through Dogtail, navigates sidebar routes, and captures deterministic screenshots using ImageMagick `import`.
